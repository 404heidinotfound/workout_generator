# workout_generator
MyProject creates random CrossFit workouts based on an Excel or CSV file with exercises. It can either generate a single WOD or save a 4-week training plan in CSV format.  The exercises are divided into categories: - Classic (Classic CrossFit WOD) - Conditioning - Gymnastics - Oly (Weightlifting)  The plans are based on CrossFit rules and formats
